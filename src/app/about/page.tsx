                Compressionism is an emergent digital art movement on the blockchain that embraces file compression as a medium. By intentionally reducing file size, artists highlight the artifacts, pixelation, distortion, and algorithms that emerge which lean into the constraints that blockchains provide. Compression occurs at many steps in the process and can vary by many degrees. My implementation is just one of many ways to work as a self-proclaimed compressionist.

                This site is my way of documenting the moment. I'm tired of asking for permission, and writing essays no one reads. I'm minting, indexing, and distributing the work as it pop into my brain. This is about moving the space forwardâ€”own it, cherish it, and help me push it further.
